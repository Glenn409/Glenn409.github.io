            <p  style='text-indent: 30px;'>Hi my name is Christopher Glenn (I'm on the right!). Some history about me, I was first introduced to programming in College.
                 I went to Missouri State for computer science. My reason for pursuing computer science was because it had the word "computer"
                  in its name and that I grew up on a computer as a kid. The skills I learned at school were:<br>- Python<br>- C#</p>

        </div>
        <div class='second-row'>
            <p class="para" style='text-indent: 30px;'>I spent two years there, I ended up hating college but felt the opposite about programming.
                 I decided to drop out, I had no further interest in school.
                  So I moved back home worked at a lake bar in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri.
                  This is where I spent alot of my time growing up and maturing.</p>

            <p class='para' style='text-indent: 30px;'>
                After a while, during the off seasons at work I started to learn how to program on my own terms learning through Codecademy. I ended up getting three certificates from Codecademy: <a target='_blank' id='certs' href='https://www.credential.net/profile/christopher834/wallet'>Link to my Certificates.</a>
                <br><br>- Build Front-End Web Apps from Scratch
                <br>- Build Web APIs from Scratch
                <br>- Freelance Website Developement
            </p>

            <p class="para" style='text-indent: 30px;'>After sometime I recieved a promotion at work and business started to pick up, I had to put down programming for a bit.
                Which now finally brings us to this year. I realized I want to challenge and push myself further. I want to find a career that I can build on.
                I decided to get back into programming because I find it complex, fun, and I love the sense of accomplishment when you build something.
                So I decided to move to the Kansas City area and enrolled into Kansas University's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp where I hope I can pursue a career in programming.
            </p>

                The languages/frameworks I feel like that i've been using/learning and have a strong understanding are:
