            <p  style='text-indent: 30px;'>Hi my name is Christopher Glenn (I'm on the right!). Some history about me, I was first introduced to programming in College.
                 I went to Missouri State for computer science. I was first introduced to:<br>- Python<br>- C#</p>

        </div>
        <div class='second-row'>
            <p class="para" style='text-indent: 30px;'>I spent two years there, I ended up disliking college but felt the opposite about programming.
                 I decided to drop out, I had no further interest in school.
                  So I moved back home worked at a lake bar in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri.
                 </p>

            <p class='para' style='text-indent: 30px;'>
                After a while, I started to learn how to program on my own terms learning through Codecademy. I wrote a few discords bots and ended up getting three certificates from Codecademy: <a target='_blank' id='certs' href='https://www.credential.net/profile/christopher834/wallet'>Link to my Certificates.</a>
                <br><br>- Build Front-End Web Apps from Scratch
                <br>- Build Web APIs from Scratch
                <br>- Freelance Website Developement
            </p>

            <p class="para" style='text-indent: 30px;'>After doing some growing up, I realized I wanted to challenge and push myself further. I decided I wanted to pursue programming. 
                I find it complex, fun, and I love the sense of accomplishment when you build something.
                I want to establish a career where I can challenge myself and eventually make a difference somewhere in this world.
                So in order to pursue this I decided to move to the Kansas City area and enrolled into Kansas University's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.
            </p>

            <p class='para third' style='text-indent: 30px;'>
                The languages/frameworks I feel like that i've been using/learning and have a strong understanding are:
                <div id='langlist' style='display:flex; justify-content: space-around;'>
